# GAC-36K

The GAC-360K is a collection of 360,000 common-sense boolean propositions written in plain English by contributors to the OpenMind project. The quality of a large part of the propositions was extremely poor. Some weren't boolean ("What is your age?"), others had broken formatting and about a quarter consisted of very specific bits of trivia mined from Wikipedia ("Was roland von hößlin born in 1915?") or requiring in-depth knowledge of A.I. By design, the project also consisted of a lot of ambiguous propositions, which had very limited use in my case.

I've attempted to filter out those questions using primitive regexes. I probably removed a lot of good propositions and kept a lot of shitty ones, but the overall quality has significantly improved.
